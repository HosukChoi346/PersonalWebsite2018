<h1> Hosuk Choi a.k.a John Choi</h1>
<p> Hey! Iâ€™m Hosuk Choi, but I go by John. I have one little brother and 3 step-sisters (all older), a mom, and a step-dad. I used to be very interested in gaming, and I still am, but I have steered off of that path for a while. I think my biggest hobby honestly is wasting time. I came to Tech because, honestly, it was the best school that I got into. I had also taken dual-enrollment math at Tech so I had an idea of what it would be like. People also told me that I would really like it here considering the kind of person I was and I have yet to find evidence that they were wrong. The number one thing I probably want from Tech directly is a degree, but I think I also want to improve myself a lot. I have made a lot of mistakes and careless errors during my time so far, and I really hate making mistakes. Especially ones that affect others as well as me. Welcome to my recollection of Korea. P.S. I worked on this alone and with the provided HTML CSS guides. Big thanks to Cory for the crash course in HTML and CSS!
