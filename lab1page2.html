	<h1> My Reflection</h1>
	<p> This summer, I had the luxury of going to Korea (first time in about 10 years). I had so many things that I wanted to do and see and realize about Korea and about myself. I felt like this solo trip to Korea would really enlighten me more about the variety of the world and about who I am in particular.</p>
	<h2>The FOOD</h2>

<p> I think the first thing that comes to mind among many things is the food. The food in Korea is so good. There's so much to eat and there's a lot of variety. There's just something about eating exotic foods that you never have access to in the US. And, in comparison to the food served here at Tech, I cry when I reminisce about the food that I ate in Korea. My favorite by far had to be the domesticated hanwoo steak there. This particular cut was around $50 (meat in Korea is very expensive). The steak literally melted in my mouth and I lack the vocabulary to give the experience justice. When you usually cut steak, it bleeds juices, but this steak didn't drop a single drop of juice while being cut. When you bite into it, every single bite overflows with savory flavors that I had never experienced before.

<h3>The View</h3>

<p>Another thing comes up when I think of Korea is the night. There, the age to party is 19 (American age) or 20 Korean age. So, I unfortunately could not do that. But, there is another form of nightlife that I found very enjoyable. There are lots of views and night lights and skylines to see in korea. I also went night biking along rivers. The view of the city while biking down a highway and riding right next to a myriad of cars was really appealing to me. I feel like that is not as accessible as anywhere else and biking in nature is nice, but I much prefer biking in Seoul during the night.</p>

<p>I think my favorite thing to do that wasn't in regards to places or activities was to hang out with my family and friends. I think here in America, I was consumed with gaming and lost the sense of family after getting a lot of new family members (my mom remarried). In Korea, I felt a lot of what it meant to be a family again and revalued a lot of my actions and priorities. After spending time with my newphew and niece, I also realized that I want to be a dad. I want to raise beautiful kids (one daughter and one son, daughter first). I think this is probably the biggest thing that I learned about myself while in Korea. These pictures above are me at a Traditional Korean palace with my friend in Korea. I also got to try on traditional Korean clothing, so that was pretty neat! P.S. click on the photo of traditional clothing for more info on the palace!</p>

<p>There's so much to see and do in Korea. I cannot wait to go back and enjoy it even more next time. I also want to travel to a lot more places and gain a lot of experiences and get to know myself more in the future. I think my trip this summer was a good eye opener, but I think there's so much more about myself and the world that I have yet to realize. Hopefully, Tech will be a place where I can grow that much more.</p>
