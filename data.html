	<p> The kind of data that I would like to resarch is viewership of online games. League of Legends or Dota 2 in particular. I enjoy playing these games and I used to play a lot of these when I was in highschool. I feel like the viewership, however, has been on a decline for league and a rise for Dota. I think as time goes by the viewers for League are declining and Dota's viewers are increasing. I would be very interested in finding out data stats about either of these two games' viewerships. I could possibly get some data from Twitch, the leading streaming site for these games.</p>
